# Wilk's neoVIM Setup

## External Requirements

These are the most unorthodox requirements. Mind other requirements might still apply, such as `nodejs` to be available in your environment, or that you have `C` and `C++` compilers. The list below has the requirements (at the time this was set up) that I deemed less probable to be generally present in people's environments.

- [tree-sitter-cli](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/crates/cli/README.md) - Required by [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - Required by [nvim-telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim).
- [lua-language-server](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) - Required for Lua LSP.
- [basedpyright](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright) - Required for Python LSP.
- [typescript-language-server](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server) - Required for JS/TS LSP.
- [terraform-ls](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) - Required for Terraform LSP.
- [helm-ls](https://github.com/mrjosh/helm-ls) - Required for Helm LSP.
